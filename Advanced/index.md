# Working with Versions



# Creating exchanges from scratch




## Conclusion

Before, if your pipeline required creation of exchanges from certain (e.g. Revit) models, you had to manually do that by going to ACC, selecting the file, selecting the view and triggering creation of the exchange. With addition to Data Exchange GraphQL API of this new functionality, it is now possible not only to automate all this, but also it opens the way to more complex workflows, like:

- automatic creation of an exchange when Revit file was added to ACC (some Webhook API involved)
- automatic creation of an exchange for all model existent in a folder
- automatic creation of the exchanges for all 3D views a Revit file contains (some Model Derivative API involved)
and many others.

Now you've covered many possible scenarios enabled by Data Exchange GraphQL API.
From now you have more than enough to start experimenting with your custom workflows on your designs.
We also have a few samples with live demos and source code available for you to leverage.
