# Data Exchange .Net SDK Tutorial

## Introduction

The Autodesk Data Exchange SDK (.NET) is a client-side component designed to build quick integrations into Data Exchange services, simply called connector.
A connector enables end-users to easily create and consume exchanges that are specific to their applications.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the first steps in your journey with the Data Exchange .NET SDK in a quick and simple way, by going through features that the SDK offers. 

At the end of this tutorial you will have enough knowledge to build your own connector adjusted to your own need and workflows.


This tutorial is divided into 5 main sections:

1. [Prerequisites and SDK Access](./prerequisites/home/)

2. [Connecting to Data Exchange](./connection/home/)

3. [Access Data and Geometry](./crud_data/home/)

4. [Creating exchanges](./create_exchange/home/)

We'll start by ensuring that everyone addresses the prerequisites.
